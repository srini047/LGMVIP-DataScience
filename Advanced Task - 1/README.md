# Advance Task 1 - Develop A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting

**Name:** *Sriniketh J*

**Task:** *Begin your neural network machine learning project with the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge and using Tensorflow and CNN. It has a very user-friendly interface that’s ideal for beginners. Dataset can be seen on MNIST or can find <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">here</a>.*
